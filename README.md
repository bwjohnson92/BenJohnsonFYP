My final year project - Staffordshire University 2014
This is the code that I wrote and adapted for my final year project at Staffordshire University.

It involves generating large, limitless terrain (in small chunks at a time), as an example game world, before asking the system to find a path between Point A and Point B.
This software was used to examine the difference between a Dijkstra algorithm, an A* algorithm, and my modified A* that involves dramatically cutting down the search space.
Speed ups of around 60% were seen between A* and modified A*.

I'm not necessarily proud of the code standards that have been followed here, but I certainly learnt a lot whilst doing it!
